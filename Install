Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

The solution compiles with Microsoft Developer Studio 6, but has been known
to compile with the later Visual Studio.NET version. You must however import
the DSW project files to do this.

Installation of Microsoft Windows Template Library (WTL) and Microsoft Platform
SDK is required. Links for these products are available below.

To compile the projects, you should use the "Batch Build" option in Developer Studio.
This will build all the projects in the solution in the correct order.

The source distribution does not contain all the required binary files to
successfully run the application. You can copy the remaining files 
(such as CL32.DLL, SciLexer.DLL and BVRDE.XML) from the binary distribution 
to the \Bin folder to allow the application to run.

    Links

The folllowing links are needed or useful for compiling the projects:

 Microsoft WTL library
 http://wtl.sourceforge.net

 Microsoft Platform SDK
 http://msdn.microsoft.com/developer/sdk/platform.htm

 The Scintilla Editor
 http://www.scintilla.org

 Cryptlib library

    Resolving Errors

If you get errors about a missing atlres.h file you have not installed WTL
properly.

If you get errors concerning the WinInet "FtpCommand" method, you have not 
updated your MS Platform SDK files or configured it properly.
Alternatively remove the offending line from the FtpProtocol.cpp file.

Compile errors regarding an unknown ATL namespace prefix can be
corrected directly in the atldispa.h source by removing the prefix
as described in the comments.

Compile errors complaining about ambiguous symbols in ATL can be resolved by
following the instructions in the WTL 7.1 ReadMe file.

The code depends on the Microsoft version of the STL library. If you
have installed a different STL library, temporarily revert to the
Microsoft include paths to make use of the Microsoft STL version.

Compiling under Visual Studio.NET will generate a number of warnings. You
may ignore these warnings.
