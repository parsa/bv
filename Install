Basic Installation
==================


   These are generic installation instructions.

The source files need no preparation before they can be compiled. A Microsoft 
Visual C++ 6.0 project file is included in the source distribution.

Installation of Microsoft Windows Template Library (WTL), the HTML Help Workshop
and Microsoft Platform SDK is required. Links for these libraries are available 
below.

The source distribution does not contain all the required binary files to
successfully run the application. You can copy the remaining files 
(such as CL32.DLL, SciLexer.DLL and BVRDE.XML) from the binary distribution 
to the \Bin folder to allow the application to run.

Please see the file "Compiling" for compiler related instructions.
