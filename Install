Basic Installation
==================


   These are generic installation instructions.

Use the Setup.exe installation application to install the tool.
Once installed, you may find instructions in the Help file on how to deploy 
the tool in an "xcopy" fashion - but using the Setup application is always
recommended.

Please see the file "Compiling" for compiler related instructions.
