How to compile the project
==========================


   These are generic compilation instructions.

The solution compiles with Microsoft Developer Studio 6, but has been known
to compile with the later Visual Studio.NET versions. You must however import
the DSW project files to do this.

Installation of Microsoft Windows Template Library (WTL), the HTML Help Workshop
and Microsoft Windows SDK is required. Links for these libraries are available below.

To compile the projects, you should use the "Batch Build" option in Developer Studio.
This will build all the projects in the solution in the correct order.
Most compile error are solved by making sure that you have installed the latest version
of the 3rd party projects mentioned below.

One sub-project, the RemoteProject, will not compile unless you manually add a
password.h file to the solution. More information can be found in the 
Authen.cpp source file for that project.

The source distribution does not contain all the required binary files to
successfully run the application. You can copy the remaining files 
(such as CL32.DLL, SciLexer.DLL and BVRDE.XML) from the binary distribution 
to the \Bin folder to allow the application to run.

    Resolving Errors

If you get errors about a missing atlres.h or atlapp.h file you have not installed
the WTL library properly.

If you get errors concerning the WinInet "FtpCommand" method, you have not 
updated your MS Windows SDK files or configured it properly.
Alternatively remove the offending line from the FtpProtocol.cpp file.

The sub-project, RemoteProject, will not compile unless you manually add a
password.h file to the solution. More information can be found in the 
Authen.cpp source file.

Compile errors regarding an unknown ATL namespace prefix can be
corrected directly in the atldispa.h source by removing the prefix
as described in the comments or updating your Windows SDK.

Compile errors about the undefined LPNMREBARCHEVRON is also
solved by updating to the latest Windows SDK headers.

Compile errors regarding missing CLogFont classes mean that you did
not update your WTL library to the latest version. My former helper classes
are now part of the WTL library itself.

Compile errors complaining about ambiguous symbols in ATL can be resolved 
by following the instructions in the WTL ReadMe file.

Missing the "HtmlHelp.lib" or "HtmlHelp.h" files? Then you forgot to
install and add the "Microsoft HTML Help Workshop" include/lib paths
to your development environment.

The code may depend on the Microsoft version of the STL library. If you
have installed a different STL library, temporarily revert to the
Microsoft include paths to make use of the Microsoft STL version.

Compiling under Visual Studio.NET will generate a number of warnings. You
may ignore these warnings.

Compile errors mentioning "___security_cookie" may be related to the /GS
switch in the Visual Studio.NET 2005 compiler family. To sucessfully 
compile you should disable the "Buffer Security Check" setting.

The realtime C++ lexer, "cpp.l", needs a lex/yacc utility to compile. It 
is currently compiled with "flex" but other lex-tools may work.
