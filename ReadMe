Introduction:
-------------

BVRDE is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for C and C++. 
It is designed to make remote/cross-platform development easy. Its 
features include project management, application wizards, an 
integrated interactive debugger, and a powerful source editor
with source browsing and syntax highlighting.

The goal of this tool is to allow a developer to compile and debug
applications entirely on a remote computer, while editing and issuing
compile and debug commands through a local interface.
BVRDE supports a variety of network protocols to allow connection with
various remote systems. This includes FTP and secure & encrypted protocols
such as SSH and SFTP.
